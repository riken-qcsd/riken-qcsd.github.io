Our team aims to realize practical quantum computers by exploring desirable system and software designs for quantum computing. We first study the fundamentals of quantum computing and how today’s fault-tolerant quantum computers work, with the goal of enabling a broad, bird’s-eye understanding of the current landscape and future challenges. We then aim to contribute to the improvement and development of fault-tolerant quantum computers by introducing new ideas, methodologies, and implementations into overall system design and other critical components. Research topics are explored in collaboration with the supervisor based on each student’s interests and strengths, so that each student can work on a theme they feel genuinely motivated to pursue. The outcomes are first presented at domestic conferences, and then, depending on the content, submitted to physics journals and/or international conferences in computer science and related fields.

Because many of our research themes are grounded in how conventional computers work and in software development principles, we would be happy if you are interested in designing or improving new computer mechanisms and software systems. Specific knowledge of quantum computing and computer systems is learned through lectures and reading groups, depending on what you work on and what interests you. Below are examples of research topics that the faculty member has supervised or collaborated with students in the past domestic conference.
