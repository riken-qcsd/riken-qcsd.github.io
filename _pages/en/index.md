Quantum Computer System Design Research Team is a research team within the RIKEN Center for Quantum Computing (RQC), established in 2025.

Our team conducts research and development on computer systems and software to realize practical and reliable quantum computers, so-called fault-tolerant quantum computers (FTQC). In particular, we explore design methodologies for efficient and highly scalable quantum computers from the perspectives of modern computer science and software engineering, with an emphasis on translating complex and highly abstract theories and tasks into concrete designs and implementations. We also work closely with teams across various quantum-computing development projects to advance toward practical-scale fault-tolerant quantum computers.

## Research Topics
Quantum Computer System Design Research Team works on topics related to fault-tolerant quantum computing, including the following.  
For more details, please refer to [Research](./research/) and [Publications](./publication/).

- **Computer Architecture:** We propose computer architectures for high-performance fault-tolerant quantum computers by applying concepts and principles from modern computer systems.
- **Programming and Compilation:** We develop frameworks to describe applications and safely translate and optimize them into machine instructions.
- **Large-Scale Device Control:** We study methods to mitigate challenges that arise when scaling up quantum devices, and to leverage device-specific capabilities.
- **System and Software Development:** We develop software and documentation and establish foundations that promote the practical use of quantum computing.

## Join our team
The Quantum Computer System Design Research Team is recruiting people who would like to work with us on research and development toward fault-tolerant quantum computers.  
For information on how to join the team, please see [Recruitment](./recruit/). If you are a student and interested, please also refer to [For Students](./student/).
